            <div class="text">
                <p>Like most website operators, Parknav collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                    browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
                    site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Parknav's purpose in collecting non-personally
                    identifying information is to better understand how Parknav's visitors use its website. From time to
                    time, Parknav may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
                    report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Certain visitors to Parknav's websites choose to interact with Parknav in ways that require Parknav to
                    gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Parknav gathers
                    depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a Parknav
                    subscription to provide an email address. In each case, Parknav collects such information only insofar
                    as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Parknav. Parknav
                    does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can
                    always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them
                    from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Parknav may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and mobile applications.
                    For instance, Parknav may monitor the most popular parking spots. Parknav may display this information
                    publicly or provide it to others. However, Parknav does not disclose personally-identifying information
                    other than as described below.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Parknav discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those
                    of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in
                    order to process it on Parknav's behalf or to provide services available at Parknav's websites and
                    mobile applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
                    contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Parknav's
                    websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Parknav will not rent or sell
                    potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
                    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Parknav discloses potentially
                    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
                    order or other governmental request, or when Parknav believes in good faith that disclosure is
                    reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Parknav, third parties or the public at large.
                    If you are a registered user of a Parknav subscription or service and have supplied your email address,
                    Parknav may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or
                    just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Parknav and our products. We primarily use our
                    various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email
                    to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
                    mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
                    or to help us support other users. Parknav takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
                    the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information.</p>
